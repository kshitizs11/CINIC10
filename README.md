# CINIC10
CINIC-10 is an augmented extension of CIFAR-10. It contains the images from CIFAR-10 (60,000 images, 32x32 RGB pixels) and a selection of ImageNet database images (210,000 images downsampled to 32x32). It was compiled as a 'bridge' between CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, for benchmarking machine learning applications. It is split into three equal subsets - train, validation, and test - each of which contain 90,000 images.
